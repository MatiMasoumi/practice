Question1
p1.py
Write a Python program for a number guessing game. The program should meet the following requirements: I.The computer should randomly select a number consisting of 
exactly three digits. 2. The user must input a guess that is also a three-digit number. If the user enters anything other than a three-digit number, display an error
message and prompt them to try again. 3. After the user submits a valid guess, the program should: • Compare the user's guess to the computer's number. • Inform the
user if their guess is too high or too low. 4. The user has a total of 6 attempts to guess the number correctly. 5. If the user guesses correctly within 6 attempts, 
display a message indicating that they have won and show how many attempts remain. 6. If the user uses all 6 attempts without guessing correctly,
display a message revealing the correct number and indicating that they did not win. 7. Ensure the program runs smoothly and handles invalid inputs appropriately.


Question 2
p2.py
Write a Python program that does the following: I. Prompt the user to input a file extension (for example, "py" for Python files). 2.
Search the user's Desktop and all its subdirectories for files that match the provided file extension.
3. Count and display the total number of files found with that extension. Make sure the program handles various file extensions properly and provides clear output.

Question 3
project product shop main
Write a Python program to manage a list of products for a shop. Each product should have a name, a price, and a unique code. 
The program should meet the following requirements: • Add Product • Add a new product to the list. • The product should have
a unique code, and the price should be set by the user. • Ensure that the product code is unique, but the name does not need to be unique. • Display All Products •
Display all products along with their details (name, price, unique code). • Remove Product • Remove a product from the list based on its unique code. • Edit Product • 
Allow the user to edit the name or price of an existing product based on its unique code. Question 03 • Search Product • Search for a product by its unique code or name and display its details. 
• Display Product Details • Display a summary of the inventory, including the total number of products and the total value of all products. • 
Help • Display a help message that explains how to use each command in the program. Note:
The program should continue until the user types "exit" to stop the program. Note: The program should be functional.
